# 1. It is also called as coercion.
# 2. It is used to convert one data type to another by the Python interpreter automatically

num1 = 10 #num1 is an integer
num2 = 20.0 #num2 is a float
sum1 = num1 + num2 #sum1 is sum of a float and an integer
print(sum1) # Output: 30.0
print(type(sum1)) # <class 'float'>

# The Python interpreter automatically converts num1 to a float before performing the addition
