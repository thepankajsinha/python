ðŸ”€ Classification of Polymorphism

ðŸ“Œ Compile-time Polymorphism

Resolved during compilation (before the program runs).
Python does not support compile-time polymorphism like traditional function overloading because it is dynamically typed.

ðŸ•’ Runtime Polymorphism
Resolved while the program is running. Python heavily uses this.
