#Tuples is a built in data structure that is used to store multiple items in a single variable.
#List items can be of any data type.

# Characteristics of Tuples:
# Immutable: Once a tuple is created, you cannot modify, add, or remove elements.
# Ordered: Elements have a defined order, and this order is preserved.
# Indexable: You can access elements by their index, starting from 0.
# Fixed Size: The size of a tuple cannot be changed once itâ€™s created.



#create a single tuple
my_tuple = (1,)

#create a tuple with multiple elements
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

#create a tuple with mixed data types 
my_tuple = (1, "apple", 3.14, True)
